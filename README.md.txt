Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Good day,  

 

First of all, I’d like to introduce myself.  

My name is Maram, I’m 26 years old and I work as a Supervisor and a Quality Assurance in a contact center which explains my website.  

In the website you’ll find a brief on the contact center and their responsibilities and roles. On the first page you can see that I used the columns “grid model” by Bootstrap 4, and linked a stylesheet that contains CSS selectors as required and media queries for smaller devices and when printing. You will also find 4 .html links that will transfer you to every role and its page. 

Now, moving on to the “Agent Role” I styled the page with not attaching a stylesheet, you can see that I designed it using CSS selectors, tables as requested, and below you’ll find a button which falls under the bootstrap 4 component and when you click on it, it will take you back to the homepage.  

 

“Team Leader”,”CC Manager” and “Quality assurance: now these pages are different because I attached a stylesheet but this stylesheet was converted from Sass to CSS. Ofcourse I used the @extend, variable and nesting features which was a great help.  

 

Kindly note that most of my webpages will contain both ordered and unordered lists. 

 

Last, I must say that I’m really proud of my first website ever without any experience in computer science all thanks to you for making these lectures very easy, understandable and fun! 

 

Best Wishes,  

Maram
