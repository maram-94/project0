    <h1 id="intro">Team Leader/ Supervisor:</h1>
    <p>A Team Leader, often known as a supervisor or a Team Manager, is responsible for managing a team of agents.
        The Team Leaderâ€™s responsibilities are to ensure individual agents are performing against targets, while reviewing their performance and coaching them to do so.
        There is much more to the position than just that, though, as multi-tasking is very much central to the role. For example, Team Leaders are also expected to meet on a regular basis with their Manager, both to provide feedback and to receive instructions or actions
        A general list of duties, including keeping agents informed of what is happening in the center and anything that may affect them, is listed below.
